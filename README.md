# Fermi Surface from VASP calculation

## Fermi Surface

In condensed matter physics, the [Fermi Surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_surface) is the surface of iso-energy in the reciprocal space, the energy of which is referred to as the *Fermi energy* or *Fermi level*. To visualize the Fermi surface, first you have to obtain the band energies in the reciprocal space. For example, one can sample the reciprocal space primitive cell using a uniform k-points grid and then use any *ab initio* code, e.g. *VASP*, to generate the band energies on these uniform grid points. With the band energies on the uniform grid, one can either plot the iso-surface with some coding or just use  [Xcrysden](http://www.xcrysden.org/doc/fermi.html) to do the plotting work.

## Prerequisites

The following python library must be installed to run the script

* [ase](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/io/io.html)
* [spglib](https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/)
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
* [matplotlib [optional]](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [mayavi [optional]](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)

## Steps to visualize the Fermi surface

**1. Calculate the band energies using VASP.**  

Note that Gamma-centered `KOINTS` is required. 
```
Monkhorst-Pack
0
Gamma
21 21 21
 0  0  0
```
Moreover, there is *no need* to turn off the symmetry in the `INCAR` file. As is well-known, VASP utilize the symmetry to fold the k-points grid to symmetry-irreducible k-points in the BZ, which  will significantly reduce the computation cost. The script use `spglib` to unfold the irreducible k-points in BZ to the uniform k-points grid.


**2. Visualizing the Fermi surface**


+ Using Xcrysden

First, you need to generate the `bxsf` file as input for `xcrysden`

```bash
fs.py -i EIGENVAL
```

then, launch xcrysden

```bash
xcrysden --bxsf ebands3d.bxsf
```

For example, below is the the Fermi surface of `fcc Cu`

+ Using Matplotlib

```bash
fs.py --plot mpl
```
